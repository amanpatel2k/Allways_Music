### Convert Page
---
<br> The converted page is where users can convert their public playlist from any music platform to create a generic playlist stored on our database and accessible on the Playlist page. The user will enter a public ID associated with an application and select the music platform related to the playlist. An example is such a public Spotify playlist URL is https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ybZkcoA09pYekp0DIo1OP, where the ID is after the playlist/ which you will input as the public ID. Once the user enters all the parameters, the client can click the convert button to generate a generic playlist that they can view on the playlist page. </br>

<br> The playlist page displays the user's generic music playlists already converted. This page will display all the music playlists that the users converted. Users will be shown a table of detailed information regarding song titles, artists, and time duration for each of their playlists. Also, the users can now open the playlist on their desired music platform, such as Spotify or Apple Music.  </br>
