### Convert Page
---
<br> The converted page is where users can convert their public playlist from any music platform to create a generic playlist stored on our database and accessible on the Playlist page. The user will enter a public ID associated with an application and select the music platform related to the playlist. An example is such a public Spotify playlist URL is https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ybZkcoA09pYekp0DIo1OP, where the ID is after the playlist/ which you will input as the public ID. Once the user enters all the parameters, the client can click the convert button to generate a generic playlist that they can view on the playlist page. </br>

### Playlist Page

<br> The playlist page displays the user's generic music playlists already converted. This page will display all the music playlists that the users converted. Users will be shown a table of detailed information regarding song titles, artists, and time duration for each of their playlists.
